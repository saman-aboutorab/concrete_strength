# concrete_strength
In this project, we will build a regression model using the Keras library to model the same data about concrete compressive strength. We will build a regression model using the deep learning Keras library, and then we will experiment with increasing the number of training epochs and changing number of hidden layers and we will see how changing these parameters impacts the performance of the model.
